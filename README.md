Water quality monitoring system measures the water level parameters which are collected by the sensors. Flow sensor is used to stream sensor values which are stored in the cloud using AWS. Solenoid valve is used as the actuator. The microcontroller - raspberryPi acts as the gateway it collects sensor value and streams to cloud using mqtt. Real time data analytics from the data in cloud is visible on the mobile app which is cross-platform built using Ionic. The application has authentication, real time analytics and predicted water requirements as its features. For prediction of water requirement neural network is used. To access the ML model in real time and to display the predicted values we pickle the model.
